#requires -Version 5.1
#
# repo guard self-check (charter sections 0 and 3)
#
# The rule and the reasoning live in the JJ Company charter:
#   C:\Users\ojaej\orca\jj-company\CLAUDE.md   sections 0 and 3
# That section 3 names this repo as a SHARED clone: branch it with
# `git worktree`, never with `checkout -b`.
#
# ASCII-only on purpose: Windows PowerShell 5.1 decodes BOM-less .ps1 files as
# the system ANSI codepage, which mangles non-ASCII text.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   scripts\githooks\pre-commit only runs if `core.hooksPath` points at it. That
#   config is per-clone and is NOT carried by git. So the guard can be absent
#   while everything looks normal - the exact silent-failure shape charter
#   section 0 forbids.
#
#   Charter section 0 also requires that a detector be checked with an input
#   that MUST trip it. So this script does not merely read config: it RUNS the
#   hook in the primary worktree and fails if the hook lets it through.
#
# USAGE
#   powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\check-repo-guard.ps1
#   ... -Fix           also sets core.hooksPath
#   ... -Repo <path>   check a specific clone (default: the clone this script
#                      lives in, so the charter section 3 command needs no path)

# Run inside the production clone it inspected the DEVELOPMENT clone instead and
# printed STATUS: OK while production had no core.hooksPath at all. The guard
# checker itself broke the charter section 0 rule it exists to enforce - a
# detector that reports on something other than its subject is worse than none,
# because the OK is read as proof.
#
# The default now follows the script. --git-common-dir returns the PRIMARY
# tree's .git from anywhere inside a clone (primary tree or linked worktree), so
# the documented `scripts\check-repo-guard.ps1 -Fix` installs into the clone it
# was launched from, with no path to remember and none to get wrong.
